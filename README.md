# Assignment2_ProgrammingHero_21days
<h4>I completed this project as part of a 21-day BootCamp at Programming Hero. It served as my second assignment where I had to work on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.</h4> 

<p>As a newcomer to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation, the learning curve was steep initially. Understanding the basics of each technology and how they interacted took time and effort.</p>

<b>Technologies Used:</b>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<h2>I'd like to thank <q>Programming Hero</q> for providing the opportunity to work on this project and learn more about web development.</h2>
