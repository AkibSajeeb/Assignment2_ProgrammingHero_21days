# Assignment2_ProgrammingHero_21days
<p>I completed this project as part of a 21-day BootCamp at Programming Hero. It served as my second assignment where I had to work on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.</p> 

<h4>As a newcomer to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation, the learning curve was steep initially. Understanding the basics of each technology and how they interacted took time and effort.</h4>

<h5>Technologies Used:</h5>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<h3>I'd like to thank <mark><q>Programming Hero</q> <mark/> for providing the opportunity to work on this project and learn more about web development.</h3>
